processing-toolbox
==================

processing-toolbox is a machine learning python API designed for clinical data
processing.
The objective of this repository to gather in a same API useful tools for such
tasks rather than implementing new specific algorithms. That is the reason why
it relies on many widely used APIs such as `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_
or gensim <https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html>`_.
